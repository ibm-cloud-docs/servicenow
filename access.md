# Managing Users, Roles, and Privileges
{: #access}

Access to ServiceNow on IBM Cloud instances for users is controlled by the Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). 
{: shortdesc}

Every user that accesses the `ServiceNow on IBM Cloud` service in your account must be assigned an access policy with an IAM role. Review the following roles, actions, and more to help determine the best way to assign access to `ServiceNow on IBM Cloud`.

The access policy that you assign users in your account determines what actions a user can perform within the context of the service or specific instance that you select. The allowable actions are customized and defined by the `ServiceNow on IBM Cloud` service as operations that you are allowed to perform on the service. Each action is mapped to an IAM platform or service role that you can assign to a user.

If a specific role and its actions don't fit the use case that you're looking to address, you can [create a custom role](/docs/account?topic=account-custom-roles&interface=ui#custom-access-roles) and pick the actions to include.
{: tip}

IAM access policies enable access to grant at different levels. The following are some options that are included:

- Access across all instances of the service in your account
- Access to an individual service instance in your account
- Access to a specific resource within an instance

Review the following tables that outline what types of tasks each role allows when you're working with `ServiceNow on IBM Cloud`. Platform management roles enable users to perform tasks on service resources at the platform level. For example, assign user access to the service and create or delete instances. Service access roles enable user access to `ServiceNow on IBM Cloud`.

| Platform role | Description of actions                                                                                                                |

| Operator      | You can perform platform actions that are required to configure and operate service instances, such as viewing a service dashboard.   |
