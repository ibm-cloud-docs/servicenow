{: #faqs-snow}

### What is ServiceNow on IBM Cloud?
{: #what-is-snow}

IBM hosts and manages ServiceNow as a Cloud Service on IBM Cloud. IBM Cloud implements, monitors, and manages the ServiceNow Platform and associated infrastructure (network, storage, and compute resources), applies fixes and upgrades to the ServiceNow application software, infrastructure and applicable security and privacy controls. IBM also provides support for the ServiceNow application and will work with ServiceNow on your behalf.

### I provisioned a ServiceNow on IBM Cloud instance. The status has been `In Progress` for awhile now.
{: #in-progress-status}

Typically, ServiceNow on IBM Cloud instances will be provisioned within 7 days. If after 7 days, the instance is still not active, reach out to support. See [Getting Support](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/servicenow?topic=servicenow-getting-support) for more information.

### I provisioned a ServiceNow on IBM Cloud instance. How do I log in?

Once your ServiceNow on IBM Cloud instance is active, you can log in provided the initial credentials on the `Manage` page of your deployment. See [Connecting to ServiceNow](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/servicenow?topic=servicenow-connecting-to-servicenow) for more information.
