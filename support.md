{: #getting-support}

If you experience an issue or have questions when using ServiceNow on IBM Cloud, you can use the following resources before you open a support case.

- Review the [FAQs](https://test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/servicenow?topic=servicenow-faqs) in the production documentation.
- Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.

If you still can't resolve the problem, you can open a support case. For more information, see [Creating support cases](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-open-case). And, if you're looking to provide feedback, see [Submitting feedback](/docs/overview?topic=overview-feedback).
